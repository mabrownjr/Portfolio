Hi! My name is Michael. 

I've never created a website from complete stratch from beginning to end and I wanted to see what it was like to do so in 2021. I'm currently a Programmer Analyst at the American Association for the advancement of Science. It really came to a surprise to me that, throughout my career, I've used more tools and have touched more code that I maintains other people's code, but never my own. I've also never completed a full-stack development project, so this is where this project comes into play. Here is the track I'll be following: 

1. HTML ONLY
2. HTML/CSS
3. Advanced CSS (Want to see how much I can do without the need of JS)
4. Javascript (Angular or maybe some other framework)
5. ....Backend Work (I'll update on which framework I go with)

Wish me luck!
